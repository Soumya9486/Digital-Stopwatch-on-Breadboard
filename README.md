# Digital Stopwatch on Breadboard

## Overview

Digital stopwatch built on a breadboard with start, stop, and reset functions. Displays time using seven-segment displays, designed for learning digital electronics and timekeeping.

## Usage

Assemble the stopwatch on a breadboard using the provided schematics and components like IC 7490 (Decade Counter), 7 Segment Display and many other basuc gates. Learn about digital counters and timekeeping mechanisms. Well there is a small fault in the logic as well in implementation. The Reset switch ideally should not work when the Start switch is kept on, but while implementing this logic on hardware level we were facing some problems so we had to go on with this fault. In our implementation the Reset switch works even when then the stopwatch is running.
